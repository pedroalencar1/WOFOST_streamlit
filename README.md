# WOFOST App

This app used weather data from the [DWD](https://www.dwd.de/DE/Home/home_node.html) and default parameters from the Python Crop Simulation Environment ([PCSE](https://github.com/ajwdewit/pcse)). It was developed by [Pedro Alencar](https://www.oekohydro.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/pedro_alencar/) and is independent of the WOFOST developing group. 

All information used is open source. The WOFOST model can be accessed at https://github.com/ajwdewit/pcse.
